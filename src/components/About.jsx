            <p>
                I’m currently studying <span>Computer Science</span>, and my passion for technology grows stronger every day.
                My main focus is on the <span> Java programming language and the Spring Boot framework </span>, which I have been studying and coding with for two years.
                I feel confident and ready to embark on my first job using these skills.
                Initially, when I ventured into software development, I wasn’t sure which path to take, but I have now found my direction.
                <span> I am always striving to enhance my skills and knowledge</span>, and I look forward to what the future holds.
            </p>
